  <h1>Hello There, Traveler</h1>
  <p>
    This project contains a personal work-in-progress "content delivery" server. Resources used for pet projects will
    be served and updated here over time. The final vision of this project is completely undecided. If anything,
    consider it a silly toy server

  <h4>This is currently a work in progress</h4>
